Certainly! Let's break down the provided JavaScript code along with explanations:

Importing Required Modules:

const fs = require("fs");


This line imports the Node.js fs (File System) module, which provides methods for interacting with the file system. It will be used to read input files.

Dynamic Programming Check Function:

function isCompounded(word, wordSet) {
    // Function logic
}


This function implements dynamic programming to check if a given word is compounded. It takes two arguments:
word: The word to be checked.
wordSet: A Set containing all words from the input files.
Find Longest Compounded Words Function:

function findLongestCompoundedWords(words, wordSet) {
    // Function logic
}


This function iterates through an array of words and finds the longest and second longest compounded words. It takes two arguments:
words: An array containing all the words from the input file.
wordSet: A Set containing all words from the input files.

Processing Input File Function:

function processInputFile(fileName) {
    // Function logic
}


This function reads the input file, splits its content into an array of words, and then calls findLongestCompoundedWords to find the longest and second longest compounded words. It takes one argument:

fileName: The path to the input file.

Main Execution:

const inputFiles = ["Input_01.txt", "Input_02.txt"];

for (const file of inputFiles) {
    // Main execution logic
}

This part of the code iterates through the input files specified in the inputFiles array. For each file, it calls processInputFile to find the longest and second longest compounded words and then logs the results to the console.


Overall, this code efficiently utilizes dynamic programming to determine if a word is compounded and then finds the longest and second longest compounded words from the input files. It provides a clean and modular structure, making it easy to understand and maintain.
